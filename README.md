# ATLIQ HOSPITALITY ANALYSIS 



## Problem Statement

 Atliq Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality
 industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective
 decision-making in management, Atliq Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the
 luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of Atliq Grands
 wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” in order to regain their market share
 and revenue.

 However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these
 insights. Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to
 provide them with insights from their historical data.


### Project Objectives:
- Analyze historical data to identify factors contributing to the decline in market share and revenue.

- Develop predictive models to forecast future trends in room bookings, demand fluctuations, and revenue.

- Identify opportunities for revenue optimization and cost reduction through data-driven decision-making.

- Provide recommendations to improve operational efficiency, customer satisfaction, and overall business performance.

- Deliver actionable insights and reports to enable strategic decision-making at the management level.

### Scope of work:

The project will focus on analyzing historical data from Atliq Grands' multiple five-star hotels across India. Data analysis will include but is not limited to:

- Revenue trends
- Occupancy rates
- Average daily rate (ADR)
- Customer feedback and satisfaction scores
- Market segmentation and customer demographics

The analysis will aim to uncover patterns, trends, and correlations within the data to identify key drivers affecting market share and revenue. Predictive modeling techniques will be employed to forecast future trends and recommend strategies for revenue optimization.

### Methodology:
- Data Collection: Gather historical data from various sources including transactional databases, customer feedback systems, and operational records.

- Data Preprocessing: Cleanse and prepare the data for analysis by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and transforming data types as needed.

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct EDA to understand the distribution, correlations, and patterns within the data.

- Statistical Analysis: Perform statistical tests and modeling to identify significant factors affecting market share and revenue.

- Predictive Modeling: Develop predictive models using machine learning algorithms to forecast future trends and make data-driven predictions.

- Reporting and Visualization: Generate reports and visualizations to communicate insights and recommendations to the management team effectively.


### Deliverables:

- Comprehensive analysis report highlighting key findings, insights, and recommendations.

- Interactive dashboards and visualizations for monitoring performance metrics and KPIs.

- Presentation slides for management review and decision-making.

### Significance of the Project:

The successful implementation of this project will enable Atliq Grands to:

- Regain market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category.
- Make informed decisions based on data-driven insights and recommendations.
- Enhance operational efficiency and customer satisfaction to maintain a competitive edge in the hospitality industry.
